        <p>The origin of Spam musubi is believed to date back to Hawai'i during WWII when Spam was a common military ration. At the time, the military had too much Spam, which is why it became available to civilians. From there, locals combined Spam with the popular Japanese snack <em>onigiri</em>, which led to the creation of the Spam musubi we know today.</p> 
        <p>A staple piece of modern Hawaiian culture and cuisine, Spam musubi is a relatively easy and affordable meal to make. Here's how.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>1 can of Spam</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Aloha shoyu</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>Nori sheets</li>
            <li>Musubi mold</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and cook rice in a rice cooker.</li>
            <li>Mix the shoyu and sugar in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Cook the Spam in a pan over medium heat. Pan fry each side for a white. Pour the shoyu-sugar mixture all over the Spam and let it soak up the sauce. Pan fry for an additional 2 minutes as the sauce caramelizes.</li>
            <li>Assemble the musubi. Half each nori sheet, which should make two long strips. Place the musubi mold in the center of a nori strip. Scroop rice into the mold until it fills about 1/2-inch high. Place a Spam slice on top. Top it off with another layer of rice. Press down with the musubi mold handle to ensure that everything it compact. Remove the mold and wrap the nori around the rice.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
