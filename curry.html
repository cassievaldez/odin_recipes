                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>This recipe replaces the chicken katsu in popular Japanese curry with grocery store dino nuggets. Although it may sound silly, you'd be surprised how well it works! Plus, it's really easy to make.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact: Curry was not introduced to Japan by travelers from India despite the relatively short distance between countries. Japanese curry is actually <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nepjbw/a-brief-history-of-how-curry-ended-up-in-japan">a rendition on British-style curry!</a></p>

                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cut the avocado in half and extract the seed. Peel off the skin of the avocado and dice the fruit into cubes.</li>
                        <li>Place the cubed avocado in a bowl with your ice. The amount of ice used may vary depending on the size of your ice cubes. Generally, use about the same amount of ice as avocado.</li>
                        <li>Add condensed milk to taste. 1 tbsp is a good place to start.</li>
                        <li>(Optional) Add a few tablespoons of evaporated milk. This will add to the creaminess of the dessert.</li>
                        <li>Enjoy!</li>
                    </ol>
