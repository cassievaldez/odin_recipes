        <p>Fun fact: Japanese curry does not originate from Indian curry despite the relatively short distance between the countries. Japanese curry is actually a rendition on British curry!</p>
        <p>This recipe replaces the chicken katsu in popular Japanese curry with grocery store dino nuggets. Although it may sound silly, you'd be surprised how well it works! Plus, it's really easy to make.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients <em>(6 servings)</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Frozen dino nuggets</li>
            <li>1 pack of Golden Curry (or any Japanese curry)</li>
            <li>2 russet potato</li>
            <li>1 large carrot</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 stick of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Cooked rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dino nuggets. Follow the instructions for the pack of frozen nuggets. Cook as many as you think necessary.</li>
            <li>Prepare the vegetables. Wash the vegetables. Mince your garlic. Then, chop your potatoes and carrot into medium-sized portions. Soak potatoes in a bowl of water for roughly 10 minutes to remove starch.</li>
            <li>Heat a pot on medium. Add the unsalted butter and minced garlic into the pot.</li>
            <li>After the butter is melted, add all the potatoes and carrots. Stir for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 3 cups of water to the pot. Bring it to a boil. Then, turn heat to medium-low and let simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add half of the curry packet to the pot. Mix evenly and make sure it doesn't get stuck to the bottom of the pan. Let simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. If it is too thick for your liking, add more water. If it is too thin, cook longer.</li>
            <li>That's basically it! Serve with your cooked rice and dino nuggets.</li>
        </ol>
