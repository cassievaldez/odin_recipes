        <p>Growing up in a Filipino household, this <strong>avocado dessert</strong> was my savior when battling the Las Vegas summer heat. Comprised of just a handful of ingredients, this dish is sort of like a deconstructed avocado smoothie, which became popular by <a href="https://poosh.com/avocado-shake-recipe/">Kourtney Kardashian</a> a few years ago.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients <em>(1 serving)</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 avocado</li>
            <li>Condensed milk</li>
            <li>Evaporated milk (optional)</li>
            <li>Ice cubes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the avocado in half and extract the seed. Peel off the skin of the avocado and dice the fruit into cubes.</li>
            <li>Place the cubed avocado in a bowl with your ice. The amount of ice used may vary depending on the size of your ice cubes. Generally, use about the same amount of ice as avocado.</li>
            <li>Add condensed milk to taste. 1 tbsp is a good place to start.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Add a few tablespoons of evaporated milk. This will add to the creaminess of the dessert.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
