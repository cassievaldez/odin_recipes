This simple recipe website project serves to display the basic HTML skills that I have learned thusfar. 

Along with navigating through git and setting up a GitHub repository, this project demonstrates my understanding of basic HTML, including an HTML5 boilerplate, paragraphs, lists, links, images and more.
