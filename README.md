# odin_recipes

This recipe website serves as a project that displays the basic HTML skills that I have learned thusfar while following lessons provided by The Odin Project. 

Along with navigating through git and setting up a GitHub repository, this project demonstrates my understanding of basic HTML, including an HTML5 boilerplate, paragraphs, lists, links, images and more.

The recipes used in this website come from personal experience.
